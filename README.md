<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is an educational method commonly applied in academic teaching. It is characterized by the interplay between peer teachers and learners who are at a similar academic level. Although it has been shown that peer teachers benefit from participating in PAL, little is known about their perception of motivation and rewards. PAL programs which deploy peer teachers have different features. It is unclear whether these features shape the peer teachers’ perception towards their teaching activity. Here we analyzed the perception of intrinsic motivation and rewards of peer teachers from 3 different PAL programs.
We hypothesized that (i) peer teachers value different types of rewards differently and (ii) the perception of rewards depends on the program the peer teacher is enrolled in. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire which contains 33 items that measure the perception of intrinsic motivation and different reward categories. The questionnaire was distributed among peer teachers of 3 different PAL programs. We quantitatively analyzed to which extend different reward categories were appreciated. Furthermore, by multinomial regression modelling, we unraveled which rewards were specifically appreciated by peer teachers of different PAL programs.
Overall, peer teachers (n = 227) were highly intrinsically motivated. The reward category Supporting Others was appreciated the most, followed by the reward categories Self-Improvement, Feedback and Financial. The perception of intrinsic motivation partially inversely correlated with the perception of Financial Rewards. Moreover, the perception of intrinsic motivation and rewards reflected the features of each of the 3 PAL programs: Peer teachers enrolled in PAL programs which deploy peer teachers primarily to convey knowledge valued their self-improvement by learning the teaching matter themselves more. In contrast, peer teachers who enrolled in the PAL program which enables them to conceive the teaching sessions independently valued their creative leeway more and were more intrinsically motivated.
These findings go towards recommendations of the implementation and further development of PAL programs. PAL programs could specifically attract peer teachers and meet their needs as well as expectations, providing opportunities to gain knowledge and teaching experience. Ultimately, these specific features of PAL programs could indirectly be beneficial for the learners.</p>
